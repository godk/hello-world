===========

This is a short description. It describes something.
Here's a little zorch to boost the foo factor.
Zorch was added by godk, since Scout is no longer on the team
(having run off to the bar with all the remaining foo).

This is technically a neurotic readme, since it is a 
self-referential piece of prose pointing at nothing in particular,
aside from its own awkward existence.
